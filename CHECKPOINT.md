## ⚠️ What's NOT Done (Requires Manual Database Access)

### Critical Issue: Duplicate Incidents
**Problem:**
- 46 incidents in database
- 22 duplicates at location (55.68, 12.57) - Copenhagen
- 10 duplicates at location (55.62, 12.65) - Copenhagen area
- Different news articles about SAME events treated as separate incidents

**Code Fix:** ✅ Deployed (prevents NEW duplicates)
**Database Cleanup:** ❌ Not done (requires manual SQL execution)

**What you see:**
- Map shows "33" cluster marker (22 + 10 + 1)
- Multiple incidents at same spots
- Looks unprofessional

**What you need:**
- Run migration 007 in Supabase
- Merges 32 duplicates → ~14-16 unique incidents
- Each incident will have multiple sources

---

### Performance Issue: Slow API
**Problem:**
- API responds in 11.4 seconds
- Too slow for real-time tracking

**Code Fix:** ✅ Migration created
**Database Indexes:** ❌ Not applied (requires manual SQL execution)

**What you need:**
- Run migration 006 in Supabase
- Each CREATE INDEX command separately
- Expected: 11.4s → <3s (73% faster)

---

### Source Attribution Issue
**Problem:**
- All incidents show "Sources pending verification"
- Sources arrays are empty in API responses

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. ✅ API query fixed (sources subquery enabled)
2. ✅ Ingest endpoint fixed (schema mismatch resolved)
3. ✅ Scraper creates sources (verified in code)
4. ❌ Database table `incident_sources` is empty (no data saved yet)

**Why empty:**
- Previous scraper runs had buggy ingest endpoint
- Sources failed to save due to schema mismatch
- Now fixed, but table is still empty

**What you need:**
- Wait for next scraper run (every 15 minutes)
- OR manually trigger: `gh workflow run ingest.yml --ref main`
- Sources will populate on next successful run

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Merge Duplicates (5 min) 🔥
**File:** `migrations/007_merge_duplicate_incidents.sql`
**Status:** READY - All errors fixed
**How:** Supabase SQL Editor (run whole file)
**Result:** 46 → ~14-16 incidents

### Priority 2: Apply Indexes (5 min) ⚡
**File:** `migrations/006_performance_indexes.sql`
**Status:** READY - Just run commands separately
**How:** Supabase SQL Editor (6 CREATE INDEX commands, one at a time)
**Result:** 11.4s → <3s API

### Priority 3: Verify Sources (Automatic) ⏳
**Status:** Next scraper run
**ETA:** Within 15 minutes
**Result:** Sources appear in cards/popups

## 📊 Verification Checklist

**After Migration 007:**
- [ ] Incident count drops to ~14-16
- [ ] No "33" cluster on map
- [ ] Each incident has multiple source entries in database
- [ ] Map looks clean and professional

**After Migration 006:**
- [ ] API response time <3 seconds
- [ ] Page loads quickly
- [ ] Smooth user experience

**After Next Scraper:**
- [ ] Source badges appear in incident cards
- [ ] Sources visible in map popups
- [ ] "Sources pending" warnings gone

---

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Why Duplicates Exist
- **Old hash function**: Used title in hash
  - "Airport Closed" → Hash A
  - "Drones Shut Airport" → Hash B
  - Same event, different hashes, separate incidents

- **New hash function**: Uses only location+time
  - Same location + same time window = Same hash
  - Different articles → Same incident + multiple sources

### Why They Don't Auto-Fix
- Deduplication runs during ingestion (when scraper sends data)
- Existing database records are not re-processed
- Need manual merge via SQL script

### Database State
**Tables:**
- `incidents`: 46 rows (32 are duplicates)
- `incident_sources`: 1 row (the 'Merged Duplicate' placeholder)
- `sources`: Has 'Merged Duplicate' source

**After cleanup:**
- `incidents`: ~14-16 rows (unique events)
- `incident_sources`: ~32+ rows (sources from merged incidents)
- Each incident linked to multiple sources

## 🚀 Next Session

**When migrations are complete:**
1. Verify incident count (~14-16)
2. Test source attribution
3. Mobile testing
4. Performance testing
5. Consider timeline slider implementation

**Current blockers:**
- Need Supabase access to run migrations
- Waiting for source population

---

## 📞 How to Get Help

**If migrations still error:**
- Provide exact error message
- Check Supabase logs
- Can simplify scripts further

**If duplicates persist:**
- Check migration 007 ran successfully
- Verify duplicate_groups table was created
- Check DELETE actually removed rows

**For immediate help:**
- See `RUN_MIGRATIONS_SIMPLE.md`
- All errors should be fixed now
- Scripts are ready to run
