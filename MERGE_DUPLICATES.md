# 🔥 CRITICAL: Merge Duplicate Incidents

## Problem Identified

**Current:** 46 incidents in database
**Issue:** 22 at one location, 10 at another = **32 DUPLICATES!**

Different news articles about the SAME event are creating separate incidents.

**Example:**
Location 55.68, 12.57 (Copenhagen) has 22 incidents that are probably all about the same drone event!

---

## Root Cause

**Deduplication hash used title:**
- "Copenhagen Airport Closed" → Hash A
- "Drones Shut Down Airport" → Hash B
- Different titles = different hashes = separate incidents ❌

**Should be:**
- Same location + same time = Same incident + multiple sources ✅

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Scraper Deduplication (utils.py)
**Changed hash generation:**
- ❌ Before: `title + time + location`
- ✅ After: `time_window + location` (no title!)

**Result:** Same event from different sources = same hash

### 2. API Deduplication (ingest.py)
**Added duplicate check before insert:**
```python
# Check for existing incident (±1km, ±6 hours)
if existing_incident:
    # Add as source to existing incident
else:
    # Create new incident
```

### 3. Database Cleanup (migration 007)
**Merges existing duplicates:**
- Groups by location + date
- Keeps best data from each duplicate
- Creates source entries
- Deletes duplicate records

---

## How to Clean Up Database

**Run this migration to merge the 32 duplicates:**

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/007_merge_duplicate_incidents.sql
```

**OR use Supabase Dashboard:**
1. https://app.supabase.com → Your Project
2. SQL Editor → New Query
3. Copy `migrations/007_merge_duplicate_incidents.sql`
4. Run

## Expected Results

**Before:**
- 46 incidents total
- 22 at location A (duplicates!)
- 10 at location B (duplicates!)
- 14 at other locations
- Map shows "33" cluster marker

**After:**
- ~14-16 incidents total (unique events)
- 1 Copenhagen Airport event (with ~22 sources!)
- 1 Other Copenhagen event (with ~10 sources!)
- Map shows individual markers
- Sources display in cards/popups

---

## Verification

**After running migration:**

```sql
-- Check incident count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_incidents FROM incidents;
-- Should be ~14-16 instead of 46

-- Check for remaining duplicates
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as incidents_at_location,
    occurred_at::date,
    ROUND(ST_Y(location::geometry)::numeric, 2) as lat
FROM incidents
GROUP BY occurred_at::date, ROUND(ST_Y(location::geometry)::numeric, 2)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Should return 0 rows (no duplicates)

-- Check sources were created
SELECT
    i.title,
    COUNT(s.id) as source_count
FROM incidents i
LEFT JOIN incident_sources s ON i.id = s.incident_id
GROUP BY i.id, i.title
ORDER BY source_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
-- Should show incidents with multiple sources
```

**From browser:**
```bash
curl -s "https://www.dronemap.cc/api/incidents?limit=10" | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); \
  print(f'Total: {len(d)}'); \
  print(f'With sources: {sum(len(i[\"sources\"])>0 for i in d)}')"
```

---

## Safety

**This migration:**
- ✅ Preserves all data (narratives become sources)
- ✅ Uses transaction (COMMIT at end)
- ✅ Can be rolled back if issues
- ✅ Non-destructive (creates source entries first)

**Backup first (optional):**
```sql
-- Create backup of incidents table
CREATE TABLE incidents_backup_20251001 AS
SELECT * FROM incidents;
```

---

## Timeline

1. **Now**: Commit fixes to main ✅
2. **~2 min**: Vercel deploys
3. **Manual**: Run cleanup script (you do this)
4. **Result**: 46 → ~14-16 incidents
5. **Next scraper**: Will use new deduplication (no more duplicates!)

---

## Why This Matters

**Credibility:**
- ❌ 22 incidents at one spot = looks like spam/error
- ✅ 1 incident with 22 sources = looks professional

**User Experience:**
- ❌ Cluttered map with overlapping markers
- ✅ Clean map with individual events

**Data Quality:**
- ❌ Inflated incident count (misleading)
- ✅ Accurate event count with source transparency

---

**Run the cleanup script ASAP to fix the duplicate problem!**
