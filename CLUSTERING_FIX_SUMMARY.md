# DroneWatch Clustering Issue - Complete Fix Summary

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Issue**: Users seeing confusing cluster numbers on map
**Root Cause**: Multiple separate incidents sharing exact coordinates

---

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### What We Found
- ✅ **NO database duplicates** - 27 unique incidents with unique IDs
- ✅ **Deduplication working correctly** - Migration 007 successful
- ❌ **13 incidents share exact coordinates**:
  - **8 incidents** at `55.6761, 12.5683` (different dates: Sept 21 - Oct 1)
  - **5 incidents** at `55.618, 12.6476` (different dates: Sept 22 - Oct 1)

### Why This Happens
- **Generic geocoding**: Articles mentioning "Copenhagen" all get geocoded to city center
- **Fallback coordinates**: When scraper can't extract specific location, uses default
- **Legitimate separate incidents**: These are different events on different dates, NOT duplicates

## ✅ Phase 1: Frontend Improvements (COMPLETED)

### Changes Made (Commit: 8e4d06a)

**File**: `frontend/components/Map.tsx`

**Improvements**:
1. **Enhanced Spiderfying**
   - `spiderfyOnEveryZoom: true` - Spreads markers at all zoom levels
   - `spiderfyDistanceMultiplier: 1.5` - Increases spacing between markers
   - `disableClusteringAtZoom: 16` - Shows individual markers when fully zoomed

2. **Custom Cluster Icons**
   - Color-coded by size:
     - 🔵 **Blue**: 2-5 incidents (small clusters)
     - 🟣 **Purple**: 6-10 incidents (medium clusters)
     - 🟠 **Orange**: 11+ incidents (large clusters)
   - Size: 46px (larger, more visible)
   - Tooltips: "X incidents at this location - click to expand"

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Clearer visual hierarchy
   - Informative hover states
   - Improved click feedback

### Testing (Local Dev Server)
- ✅ Build successful - no errors
- ✅ Map renders correctly
- ✅ Cluster colors working (blue, purple, orange)
- ✅ Tooltips displaying correctly
- ✅ 27 incidents loading from API

### Current Limitation
⚠️ **Spiderfying doesn't work yet** because incidents have **identical coordinates**

When you click a cluster with overlapping incidents:
- ❌ **Current behavior**: Zooms in and re-clusters (14 → 8 + 4 + 5)
- ✅ **Desired behavior**: Spreads markers in a circle (spiderfy)

**Why**: Leaflet cannot spiderfy markers at the same exact lat/lon

## 📋 Phase 2: Database Migration (READY TO APPLY)

### Migration 008: Geocoding Jitter

**File**: `migrations/008_add_geocoding_jitter.sql`

**What It Does**:
- Identifies the 13 incidents sharing coordinates
- Adds small offset (+/- 0.002° ≈ 200m) in circular pattern
- Keeps first incident at original location
- Spreads others around it for visibility

**How to Apply**:
See `APPLY_MIGRATION_008.md` for detailed instructions

**Quick Steps**:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `migrations/008_add_geocoding_jitter.sql`
3. Paste and run
4. Verify 0 overlapping incidents remain

**Expected Results After Migration**:
- ✅ All 27 incidents have unique coordinates
- ✅ Clusters will spiderfy into individual markers
- ✅ Each incident clickable independently
- ✅ No more confusing re-clustering behavior

## 🎯 Summary

### Completed ✅
1. ✅ Investigated and diagnosed root cause (not duplicates!)
2. ✅ Enhanced map clustering UI (commit 8e4d06a)
3. ✅ Created migration 008 for geocoding jitter
4. ✅ Documented application process
5. ✅ Tested frontend changes locally

### Pending ⏳
1. ⏳ Apply migration 008 in Supabase (manual step required)
2. ⏳ Deploy frontend changes to production
3. ⏳ Verify spiderfying works after migration

### Future Improvements 📝
1. Improve scraper geocoding to extract precise locations
2. Add geocoding service for better accuracy
3. Implement location validation in ingestion pipeline

## 🧠 Key Learnings

**Important**: **One incident, multiple sources = one database row**

This issue was:
- ❌ **NOT** duplicate database rows
- ❌ **NOT** deduplication failure
- ✅ **YES** geocoding limitation (fallback to city center)
- ✅ **YES** multiple legitimate incidents at same generic location

**The Fix**:
- Visual separation through small geographic offsets
- Maintains data integrity while improving UX
- Two-phase approach: UI improvements + data migration

---

**Status**: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready to apply
**Next Action**: Apply migration 008 in Supabase SQL Editor
